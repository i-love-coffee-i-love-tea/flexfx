## OSGIFX

OSGiFX is the combination on JavaFX with the modularity offered by the OSGi specifications and its implementations.
Other frameworks exist that offer similar functionality such as DromblerFX which provide a rich set of GUI widgets and a standard GUI framework. OSGIFX doesn't attempt to offer this but offers a lighter way to access the modularity offered by OSGi from within JavaFX.

OSGIFX allows engineers a more flexible approach to how they wish their application to be presented and don't necessarily have to be restricted to a standard presentational style for their application.
